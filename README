This is a KControl Module which handles adding/editing/removing Telepathy
Accounts. It interacts with any Telepathy Spec compliant AccountManager,
such as telepathy-accountmanager-kwallet to manipulate the accounts. It is
modular in design, with each ConnectionManager-Protocol combination having a
plugin that provides customised forms for adding or editing their accounts,
and also with a generic plugin which can be used as a fallback for
ConnectionManager-Protocol combinations where no plugin exists.

Installation instructions (including dependency information) can be found
in the file 'INSTALL' in this directory.

Please report all bugs to http://bugs.kde.org choosing product "telepathy" and
component "accounts-kcm".
