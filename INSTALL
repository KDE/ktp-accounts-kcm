This project has a cmake buildsystem which uses the KDE4 cmake macros. It will
be very familiar to anyone who has built a KDE project before.

A snapshot version of Qt 4.5 is required to compile this app. Also, due to some
as-yet-unfixed bugs in QtDBus, the patches included in the patches directory
will need to be applied to your copy of Qt before compiling it. Nb. these
patches are just hacks to tide us over until the bugs are fixed upstream in Qt,
so they *may* break other things. You have been warned...

This project depends on the following packages:
    kdelibs >= 4.2 (svn://anonsvn.kde.org/home/kde/trunk/KDE/kdelibs)
    telepathyQt4 (git://git.collabora.co.uk/git/telepathy-qt4.git)

To build, perform the usual cmake dance:

    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ..
    make && make install

Or alternatively, if you have the .bashrc file from KDE Techbase
http://techbase.kde.org/Getting_Started/Increased_Productivity_in_KDE4_with_Scripts/.bashrc
you can simply run "cmakekde" to do everything by magic.
