This project has a cmake buildsystem which uses the KDE4 cmake macros. It will
be very familiar to anyone who has built a KDE project before.

Qt 4.5 or later is required to compile this app.

This project depends on the following packages:
    kdelibs >= 4.2 (svn://anonsvn.kde.org/home/kde/trunk/KDE/kdelibs)
    telepathyQt4 >= 0.1.8 (http://telepathy.freedesktop.org/releases/telepathy-qt4/)

To build, perform the usual cmake dance:

    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ..
    make && make install

Or alternatively, if you have the .bashrc file from KDE Techbase
http://techbase.kde.org/Getting_Started/Increased_Productivity_in_KDE4_with_Scripts/.bashrc
you can simply run "cmakekde" to do everything by magic.
