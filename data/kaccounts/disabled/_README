This folder contains provider/service files for services or accounts that are
either currently broken or not properly supported. You can install these at
your own risk and play around, but please don't report any bugs for these.

You can install these by executing:

mkdir -p build && cd build && cmake .. && make install

===============================================================================

Current disabled providers:

 * steam/ktp-haze-steam-mobile

   This requires the pidgin-opensteamworks plugin, which uses a bit of a hack
   in order to store the authentication data and supports only "libgnome-keyring.so"
   which usually requires manual symlinking of system libraries. This is very bad
   and thus is not officially supported by us. Once it's using the keyring properly
   via the APIs meant to be used or even better once it works with KWallet (properly)
   it will be moved to supported providers.
